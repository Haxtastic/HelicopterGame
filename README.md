HelicopterGame
==============

This game is a clone of the old helicopter games. Written in a little under 3 days on my free time. I wrote it because I couldn't find anything on the web that had integrated these three frameworks and I wanted to know how one would do that. It thought  me a lot of different little things.

This source code is the base for Korosu so it's a bit messy as well and weren't built to last.

But I achieved what I set out to do.
